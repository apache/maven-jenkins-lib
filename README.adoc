== Apache Maven Jenkins Shared Libraries

This repository contains the Jenkins shared libraries that define the standard build process for Apache Maven subprojects.

The shared libraries rely on a definition of the per-Jenkins instance specific configuration details.
The definition of those instance specific configuration details as customized for the Apache build server is hosted in https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf?p=maven-jenkins-env.git[maven-jenkins-env]

If you want to build the Apache Maven repositories on your own Jenkins infrastructure you will need to define two shared libraries:

. The first shared library should be a clone of https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf?p=maven-jenkins-env.git[maven-jenkins-env.git] with the environment specifics modified to match your own Jenkins environment
. The second shared library should be this shared library which defines the standard Apache Maven build process
